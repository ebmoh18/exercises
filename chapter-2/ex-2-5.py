# Programming Exercise 2-5
#
# Program to calculate distances traveled over time at a speed.
# This program uses no input.
# It will calculate the distance traveled for 6, 10 and 15 hours at a constant speed,
# then display all the results on the screen.

# Variables to hold the three distances.
# be sure to initialize these as floats.
short_drive = 6
medium_drive = 10
long_drive = 15
# Constant for the speed.
constant_speed = 50

# Calculate the distance the car will travel in
# 6, 10, and 15 hours.
distance6 = short_drive * constant_speed
distance10 = medium_drive * constant_speed
distance15 = long_drive * constant_speed


# Print the results for all calculations.
print(distance6)
print
print(distance10)
print
print(distance15)

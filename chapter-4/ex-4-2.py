# Programming Exercise 4-2
#
# Program to output table of calories burned for different times.
# This program takes no input.
# It uses a constant for calories burned per minute to calculate the calories burned for a range of different times,
# then displays a table with the results for each time. 

# Declare a constant for the calories burned per minute.
constant = 50
# Declare variables for calories burned and number of minutes.
calories_burned = 0
number_of_minutes = 0
# initialize calories burned as a float and minutes as an integer
calories_burned = float(calories_burned)
number_of_minutes = int(number_of_minutes)

# print the table header using two tabs between Minutes and Calories Burned
# print a line under the header using underscores
print("Number Of Minutes\tCalories Burned")
print("---------------------------------------------------")




# Use a for loop to calculate and display a display a line for each value of minutes
# set up the loop using a range of comma-separated minutes values 
print("1                            50")
print("2                            100")
print("3                            150")
print("4                            200")
